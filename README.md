    The program is used to simulate 2D Ising model with the primary application of Matlab. I choose the simple method of Single-spin-flip dymanics to deal with this task. 
    Before running the program, you should add all the files into Matlab path. You'd better run the program in ising.m unless you want to improve my code.
    Enjoy your time with Ising and Matlab! Suggestions and adjustment(as well as likes) are welcomed.

    You can change temporature range and repeat times in ising.m and adjust paramaters in ising_.m simply by changing the default values.
