# 2D-Ising-Model-Matlab

## Description

Simulating 2D Ising model with Monte Carlo Method in Matlab.

-Bill in Chengdu

## Tutorial

The program is used to simulate 2D Ising model with the primary application of Matlab. I choose the simple method of Single-spin-flip dymanics to deal with this task. 

Before running the program, you should add all the files into Matlab path. You'd better run the program in ising.m unless you want to improve my code.

You can change temperature range and repeat times in ising.m and adjust paramaters in ising_.m simply by changing the default values.

Enjoy your time with Ising and Matlab! Suggestions and adjustments(as well as STARs) are welcomed.

GOOD NEWS! A detailed introduction of Simulating 2D Ising Model has been uploaded on ZHIHU. It is a Chinese version,  [click here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/42629484) to view.
