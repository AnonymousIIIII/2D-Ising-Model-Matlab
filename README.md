# 2D-Ising-Model-Matlab
Simulating 2D Ising model with Monte Carlo Method in Matlab.

### Tutorial ###
The program is used to simulate 2D Ising model with the primary application of Matlab. I choose the simple method of Single-spin-flip dymanics to deal with this task. 

Before running the program, you should add all the files into Matlab's work directory. You'd better run the program in ising.m unless you want to improve my code.

Enjoy your time with Ising and Matlab!
